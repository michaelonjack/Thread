Those features are available just with a few lines of code!

## Improvements
YPImagePicker was built from the great Fusuma library.

Here are the improvements we added :
- Improve Overall Code Quality
- Simplify API
- Added Filters View ala Instagram
- Replaces icons with lighter Text
- Preselect Front camera (e.g for avatars)
- Scroll between tabs which feels smoother
- Grab videos form the library view as well
- Replaces Delegate based with callbacks based api
- Uses Native Navigation bar over custom View (gotta be a good UIKit citizen)

## Installation

Drop in the Classes folder to your Xcode project.  
You can also use CocoaPods or Carthage.

#### Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

Add `pod 'YPImagePicker'` to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`. Also add `use_frameworks!` to the `Podfile`.

```
target 'MyApp'
pod 'YPImagePicker'
use_frameworks!
```

#### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add `github "Yummypets/YPImagePicker"` to your `Cartfile` and run `carthage update`. If unfamiliar with Carthage then checkout their [Getting Started section](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).

```
github "Yummypets/YPImagePicker"
```

## Plist entries

In order for your app to access camera and photo libraries,
you'll need to ad these `plist entries` :

- Privacy - Camera Usage Description (photo/videos)
- Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description (library)
- Privacy - Microphone Usage Description (videos)

## Usage

`import YPImagePicker` then use the following:

```swift
let picker = YPImagePicker()
// picker.onlySquareImages = true
// picker.showsFilters = false
// picker.startsOnCameraMode = true
// picker.usesFrontCamera = true
// picker.showsVideo = true
picker.didSelectImage = { img in
    // image picked
}
picker.didSelectVideo = { videoData in
    // video picked
}
present(picker, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
